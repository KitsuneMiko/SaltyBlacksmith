# SaltyBlacksmith
Portfolio project for Twitch.tv streamer King_Salt


This is a portfolio project made specifically to satisfy requirements in NuCamp Coding Bootcamp.
I chose to create a blacksmith's e-commerce website for King_Salt, it is a hypothetical site and is not functional.
This site is only to showcase skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 4.

More info will be forthcoming as the project advances.
